Key requirements

 

Adaptable to most freight systems using similar workflow

Standardised workflow as the software is only doing one Post and then parsing the response


Receive JSON file from the WMS or read data from a table populated by the WMS to create a JSON file to POST to the freight/carrier system


Send Post to create a shipment label with appropriate security credentials
                                                               i.      Weâ€™ll need to explore the likely range of security credentialling to understand the variations in requirements

Parse the response into a database
Trigger a cloud print command to print it to the local label printer set up in the WMS
There looks to be a variety of options from 3rd parties and printer manufacturers that will support cloud printing.

This would be a sub-project and not the primary goal but understanding the options will inform the development
